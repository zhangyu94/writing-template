An archive of the assets related to the review process (e.g., submissions, reviews, responses, and revisions).

## File Structure

If the paper is accepted within one round of submission, the assets can be organized as follows:

- `./1-submission`: the initial submitted version of the paper
- `./2-revision`: the original review, the review summary, the revised version of the paper, and the response to the reviewers
- `./3-camera-ready`: the camera-ready version of the paper

If the paper has undergone multiple rounds of submission, the assets can be organized as follows:

- `./{venue1}`: the first round of submission to `venue1`
    - `./1-submission`
    - `./2-revision`
- `./{venue2}`: the second round of submission to `venue2`
    - `./1-submission`
    - `./2-revision`
- `...`
- `./{venueN}`: the N-th round of submission to `venueN`
    - `./1-submission`
    - `./2-revision`
    - `./3-camera-ready`
