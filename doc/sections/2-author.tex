\section{Author Details}

You should specify ORCID IDs for each author (see \url{https://orcid.org/}  to register) for disambiguation and long-term contact preservation.
Use \verb|\authororcid{Author Name}{0000-0000-0000-0000}| for each author, replacing the ``Author Name'' and using the 16-digit (hyphenated) ORCID ID for the second parameter.
The template shows an example without ORCID IDs for two of the authors.
ORCID IDs should be provided in all cases.

Each author's affiliations have to be provided in the author footer on the bottom-left corner of the first page.
It is permitted to merge two or more people from the same institution as long as they are shown in the same order as in the overall author sequence on the top of the first page.
For example, if authors A, B, C, and D are from institutions 1, 2, 1, and 2, respectively, then it is ok to use 2 bullets as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A and C are with Institution 1. E-mail: \{a\,$|$\,c\}@i1.com\,.

  \item B and D are with Institution 2. E-mail: \{b\,$|$\,d\}@i2.org\,.
\end{itemize}
