\section{References}
\label{sec:references_inst}

An example of the reference formatting is provided in the \textbf{References} section at the end.

\subsection{Include DOIs}

All references which have a DOI should have it included in the bib\TeX\ for the style to display.
The DOI can be entered with or without the \url{https://doi.org/} prefix.

\subsection{Narrow DOI option}

The \verb|-narrow| versions of the bibliography style use the font \verb|PTSansNarrow-TLF| for typesetting the DOIs in a compact way.
This font needs to be available on your \LaTeX\ system.
It is part of the \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/paratype}{\texttt{paratype} package}, and many distributions (such as MikTeX) have it automatically installed.
If you do not have this package yet and want to use a \verb|-narrow| bibliography style then use your \LaTeX\ system's package installer to add it.
If this is not possible you can also revert to the respective bibliography styles without the \verb|-narrow| in the file name.
DVI-based processes to compile the template apparently cannot handle the different font so, by default, the template file uses the \texttt{abbrv-doi} bibliography style.

\subsection{Disabling hyperlinks}

To avoid adding hyperlinks to the references (the default) you can use \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi}| instead of \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi-hyperref}|.
By default, the DOI field in a bib\TeX\ entry is turned into a hyperlink.

See the examples in the bib\TeX\ file and the bibliography at the end of this template.

\subsection{Guidelines for bibTeX}

\begin{itemize}
  \item All bibliographic entries should be sorted alphabetically by the last name of the first author.
        This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of this sorting automatically.
  \item Merge multiple references into one; e.\,g., use \cite{Max1995OpticalModelsDirect,Kitware2003VisualizationToolkitUsers} (not \cite{Kitware2003VisualizationToolkitUsers}\cite{Max1995OpticalModelsDirect}).
        Within each set of multiple references, the references should be sorted in ascending order.
        This \LaTeX/bib\TeX\ template takes care of both the merging and the sorting automatically.
  \item Verify all data obtained from digital libraries, even ACM's DL and IEEE Xplore  etc.\ are sometimes wrong or incomplete.
  \item Do not trust bibliographic data from other services such as Mendeley.com, Google Scholar, or similar; these are even more likely to be incorrect or incomplete.
  \item Articles in journal---items to include:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item author names
          \item title
          \item journal name
          \item year
          \item volume
          \item number
          \item month of publication as variable name (i.e., \{jan\} for January, etc.; month ranges using \{jan \#\{/\}\# feb\} or \{jan \#\{-{}-\}\# feb\})
          \item series. E.g., ``TVCG``, ``TVCG/VIS`` for special issue VIS papers, ``EuroVis``, ``CGF/EuroVis``.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Use journal names in proper style: correct: ``IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'', incorrect: ``Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on''
  \item Papers in proceedings---items to include:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item author names
          \item title
          \item abbreviated proceedings name: e.g., ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CONF\_ACRONYNM'' without the year; example: ``Proc.\textbackslash{} CHI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} 3DUI'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} Eurographics'', ``Proc.\textbackslash{} EuroVis''
          \item year
          \item series. E.g., ``VIS`` and ``EuroVis`` for short papers, ``CHI``...
        \end{itemize}

  \item Article/paper title convention: refrain from using curly brackets, except for acronyms/proper names/words following dashes/question marks etc.; example:\\\\
        %
        The paper ``Marching Cubes: A High Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm'' should be entered as ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A High Resolution \{3D\} Surface Construction Algorithm'' or  ``\{M\}arching \{C\}ubes: A high resolution \{3D\} surface construction algorithm''.
        It will then be typeset as ``Marching Cubes: A high resolution 3D surface construction algorithm''.
  \item For all entries:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item DOI can be entered in the DOI field as plain DOI number or as DOI url.
          \item ``pages`` or ``articleno``: Provide full page ranges AA-{}-BB, OR, if an article number is available like recent ACM conferences, use that instead. E.g., see the entry for Panavas et al.\ \cite{Panavas2022JuvenileGraphicalPerception}.
        \end{itemize}
  \item When citing references, do not use the reference as a sentence object; e.g., wrong: ``In \cite{Lorensen1987MarchingCubesHigh} the authors describe \dots'', correct: ``Lorensen and Cline \cite{Lorensen1987MarchingCubesHigh} describe \dots''
\end{itemize}
