\subsection{ifpdf error}

If you receive compilation errors along the lines of \texttt{Package ifpdf Error: Name clash, \textbackslash ifpdf is already defined} then please add a new line \verb|\let\ifpdf\relax| right after the \verb|\documentclass[journal]{vgtc}| call.
Note that your error is due to packages you use that define \verb|\ifpdf| which is obsolete (the result is that \verb|\ifpdf| is defined twice); these packages should be changed to use \verb|ifpdf| package instead.

\subsection{\texttt{pdfendlink} error}

Occasionally (for some \LaTeX\ distributions) this hyper-linked bib\TeX\ style may lead to \textbf{compilation errors} (\texttt{pdfendlink ended up in different nesting level ...}) if a reference entry is broken across two pages (due to a bug in \verb|hyperref|).
In this case, make sure you have the latest version of the \verb|hyperref| package (i.e.\ update your \LaTeX\ installation/packages) or, alternatively, revert back to \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi}| (at the expense of removing hyperlinks from the bibliography) and try \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi-hyperref}| again after some more editing.
